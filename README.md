There are a few points to note before running the notebook.

- I am using python3 on Jupyter notebook. If you happen to be using python2, make the corresponding changes before running the notebook.

- Make sure the following libraries are installed:
	1. numpy.
	2. lxml.
	3. bs4. (BeautifulSoup)
	4. sklearn.
  I guess rest of the libraries come preinstalled with python3

- I guess I have covered the remainig details in the notebook. Have fun classifying!!
